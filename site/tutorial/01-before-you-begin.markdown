This tutorial assumes that you have some knowledge of the Dart
programming language and development environment. It assumes you have
no knowledge of Angular, but that you do know basic HTML and CSS.

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have a Dart
development environment and the tutorial’s sample code.

### Get a Dart development environment

The easiest way to get started with AngularDart is to install Dart Editor:

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/editor/">
      www.dartlang.org/tools/editor/</a></p>
</blockquote>

When you download Dart Editor, you also get the Dart SDK (which
includes Dart command-line tools) and Dartium—a build of Chromium with
the Dart VM. For more information about Dart tools, see
[www.dartlang.org/tools/](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/).

### Get the tutorial sample code

All of the code in this tutorial is visible at
[github.com/angular/angular.dart.tutorial](https://github.com/angular/angular.dart.tutorial).
We recommend that you get a local copy, either by cloning the repo or
by downloading the
[ZIP file](https://github.com/angular/angular.dart.tutorial/archive/master.zip).

### New to Dart?

If you’re new to Dart, take some time to familiarize yourself with the
basics of the Dart language and application structure. The Dart
documentation lives at
[www.dartlang.org](https://www.dartlang.org/). You can start with any of these:
